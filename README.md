# miniscope_fullstack

Built for the data collected in collaboration with Michelle Phan, Karley Tioran, Yuqi Zhang, and Dyala Omar under the guidance of Dr. Huang and Prof. Gao from UCLA.

Just point the repository to your miniscope files, run the code, and get detailed plots and analyses of the mechanical and calcium fluorescence patterns. Comparison plots are particularly useful in determining statistical significance between different groups (e.g. different drugs on cardiac organoids, infarction-modelling, etc.).

How to run:
do source .miniscope/bin/activate or the equivalent
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py

Install as a module for use from another Python project:
* python -m pip install -e .
* python -c "import miniscope_fullstack.main; import miniscope_fullstack.helper_functions"

To run the streamlit (for an easier UI)
* pip install streamlit
* pip install cellpose
* streamlit run app.py

And enjoy selecting the files you want to run it on from a locally-hosted webapp! No need to go rifling around files.

python main.py will do the following:
1) run trace_extraction, which will give you the peak plots + ROIs annotated on the first frame for verification
1) Provide metrics (e.g. frequency of beating , irregularity, decay90, etc.) from the data 
1) Creative comparative plots for different drug concentrations and types with the organoids.

If you want to run it on multiple files at once:
* not recommended that you try doing this until you process a couple files (mechanically and fluorescent-wise) yourself, so you can kind of see what you should expect from your data and don't get surprised.
* you can just do python batch_process.py. For files that are difficult to select the ROI of using cellpose, you can manually select the borders for the organoids yourself.
* you'll get all sorts of plots for calcium transience and contractility measurements. Examples can be found in (insert link here)

**Output includes:**
1) Mechanical contractility
2) Calcium transience patterns
3) Metrics, including CD90!
4) In multi-mode, comparative plots of your different testing conditions (different drugs, electrical pacing conditions, etc.)
